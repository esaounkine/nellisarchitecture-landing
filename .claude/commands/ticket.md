description: Drive a Trello card through the development pipeline (docs/workflow/development.md). Read the card's current state. Start the hat for that state. Stop at human gates.
argument-hint: <card-url>
---

You are the **orchestrator** of the development pipeline. Read the spec first: the README, then **docs/workflow/development.md**. The spec names the states, the roles, the board conventions, and the **Bindings** (Trello API, commands, Netlify). Task: **$1**

1. Read the card from the board. Note the card's **list**. The list is the current pipeline state.
2. Start the hat for that state. Do **only** that state's work. Then **HALT**. Report each item:

   - the current state
   - the hat you used
   - what you produced
   - the next action that waits for the person

   State instructions:

   - **Backlog** → Move the card to To do only if the person has prioritised the card. If not, stop and ask.
   - **To do** → Delegate to `architect`. The architect checks for duplicates, fits the task to the site, and writes the design (if a decision is needed) and the plan. Write the plan to the card as a comment. Move the card to **Architect BR**. Do not implement.
   - **Architect BR** → Delegate to `bar-raiser` for a design review of the plan. Write the verdict as a comment. **HALT for the person to sign off the design.** On sign-off, move the card to **In Progress**. On BLOCK, move the card back to **To do** with the findings.
   - **In Progress** → Delegate to `dev`. The dev implements the signed-off plan with tests. Run the checks. Commit a checkpoint. Do not push. Write the commit hash as a comment. Move the card to **Test**. A committed implementation with passing checks must never stay in **To do** or **In Progress**.
   - **Test** → Run the checks (see the Bindings). If they pass, move the card to **Dev BR**. If anything fails, move the card back to **In Progress** with the failures.
   - **Dev BR** → Delegate to `bar-raiser` for a code and test review. Write the verdict as a comment. PASS → move the card to **Review**. BLOCK → move the card back to **In Progress** with the findings.
   - **Review** → Delegate to `qa`. On PASS, **HALT for the person to review, sign off, and push.** On BLOCK, move the card back to **In Progress** with the list.
   - **Shipping** → The person has pushed. Run the deploy check (see the Bindings). Report. **HALT for the person to confirm complete → Done.**
   - **Done** → Nothing to do. Report. Follow-ups go to Backlog.
   - **Blocked** → Report the blocker comment. Ask the person how to proceed.
   - **Closed** → Nothing to do. Report.

3. **Every card move MUST include the comment its state requires.** See docs/workflow/development.md → "Board conventions".
4. **Never** move a card to Done or Closed yourself. **Never** `git push`. These are the person's tasks.
